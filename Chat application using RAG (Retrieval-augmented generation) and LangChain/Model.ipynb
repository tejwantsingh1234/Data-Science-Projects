As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and develop our services\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for using our services\\n\\n\\n\\nContent in Google services, which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you find in our services — whether that content belongs to you, Google, or others\\n\\n\\n\\nIn case of problems or disagreements, which describes other legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms\\n\\n\\n\\nUnderstanding these terms is important because, by accessing or using our services, you’re agreeing to these terms.\\n\\n\\n\\nBesides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy. Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.\\n\\n\\n\\nTerms\\n\\n\\n\\nService provider\\n\\nGoogle services are provided by, and you’re contracting with:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle LLC\\n\\norganized under the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, and operating under the laws of the USA\\n\\n\\n\\n1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, California 94043 USA\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAge requirements\\n\\nIf you’re under the age required to manage your own Google Account, you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use a Google Account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read these terms with you.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the services, then these terms apply to you and you’re responsible for your child’s activity on the services.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome Google services have additional age requirements as described in their service- specific additional terms and policies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYour relationship with Google\\n\\n\\n\\nThese terms help define the relationship between you and Google. When we speak of “Google,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” we mean Google LLC and its affiliates, excluding any local entities based in India. Broadly speaking, we give you permission to access and use our services if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect how Google’s business works and how we earn money.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat you can expect from us\\n\\n\\n\\nProvide a broad range of useful services\\n\\n\\n\\nWe provide a broad range of services that are subject to these terms, including:\\n\\n\\n\\napps and sites (like Search and Maps)\\n\\n\\n\\nplatforms (like Google Shopping)\\n\\n\\n\\nintegrated services (like Maps embedded in other companies’ apps or sites)\\n\\n\\n\\ndevices (like Google Nest and Pixel)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMany of these services also include content that you can stream or interact with.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOur services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. For example, if your Calendar event includes an address, you can click on that address and Maps can show you how to get there.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDevelop, improve, and update Google services\\n\\n\\n\\nWe’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we use artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide you with simultaneous translations, and to better detect and block spam and malware. As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones. When a service requires or includes downloadable or preloaded software, that software sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some services let you adjust your automatic update settings.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. We’ll also provide you with an opportunity to export your content from your Google Account using Google Takeout, subject to applicable law and policies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat we expect from you\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow these terms and service-speci c additional terms\\n\\nThe permission we give you to access and use our services continues as long as you comply with:\\n\\n\\n\\nthese terms\\n\\n\\n\\nservice-specific additional terms, which could, for example, include things like additional age requirements\\n\\n\\n\\nWe also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services. These resources include our Privacy Policy, Copyright Help Center, Safety Center, Transparency Center,and other pages accessible from our policies site. Finally, we may provide specific instructions and warnings within our services – such as dialog boxes that alert you to important information.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough we give you permission to use our services, we retain any intellectual property rights we have in the services.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRespect others\\n\\nWe want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means you must follow these basic rules of conduct:\\n\\n\\n\\ncomply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, money laundering, and human trafficking laws\\n\\n\\n\\nrespect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights\\n\\n\\n\\ndon’t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) including against children — for example, by misleading, defrauding, illegally impersonating, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others; hosting or publishing any obscene content; or inciting the violation of applicable laws\\n\\n\\n\\nOur service-specific additional terms and policies, such as our Generative AI Prohibited Use Policy, provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those services must follow. If you find that others aren’t following these rules, many of our services allow you to report abuse. If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide the process described in the Taking action in case of problems section.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon’t abuse our services\\n\\nMost people who access or use our services understand the general rules that keep the internet safe and open. Unfortunately, a small number of people don’t respect those rules, so we’re describing them here to protect our services and users from abuse. In that spirit:\\n\\nYou must not abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt our services or systems — for example, by:\\n\\n\\n\\nintroducing malware\\n\\n\\n\\nspamming, hacking, or bypassing our systems or protective measures\\n\\n\\n\\njailbreaking, adversarial prompting, or prompt injection, except as part of our safety and bug testing programs\\n\\n\\n\\naccessing or using our services or content in fraudulent or deceptive ways, such as:\\n\\n\\n\\nphishing\\n\\n\\n\\ncreating fake accounts or content, including fake reviews\\n\\n\\n\\nmisleading others into thinking that generative AI content was created by a human\\n\\n\\n\\nproviding services that appear to originate from you (or someone else) when they actually originate from us\\n\\n\\n\\nproviding services that appear to originate from us when they do not\\n\\n\\n\\nusing our services (including the content they provide) to violate anyone’s legal rights, such as intellectual property or privacy rights\\n\\n\\n\\nreverse engineering our services or underlying technology, such as our machine learning models, to extract trade secrets or other proprietary information, except as allowed by applicable law\\n\\n\\n\\nusing automated means to access content from any of our services in violation of the machine-readable instructions on our web pages (for example, robots.txt files that disallow crawling, training, or other activities)\\n\\n\\n\\nusing AI-generated content from our services to develop machine learning models or related AI technology\\n\\n\\n\\nhiding or misrepresenting who you are in order to violate these terms\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLicense\\n\\nYour content remains yours, which means that you retain any intellectual property rights that you have in your content. For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative content you make, such as reviews you write. Or you may have the right to share someone else’s creative content if they’ve given you their permission.\\n\\nWe need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content. You provide Google with that permission\\n\\nthrough this license.\\n\\nLicense\\n\\nYour content remains yours, which means that you retain any intellectual property rights that you have in your content.

You provide Google with that permission\\n\\nthrough this license.providing services that encourage others to violate these terms\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPermission to use your content\\n\\n\\n\\nSome of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share your content. You have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you’re free to choose the content that you want to provide. If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat’s covered\\n\\nThis license covers your content if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat’s not covered\\n\\n\\n\\nThis license doesn’t affect your privacy rights — it’s only about your intellectual property rights\\n\\n\\n\\nThis license doesn’t cover these types of content:\\n\\n\\n\\npublicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the address of a local business. That information doesn’t require a license because it’s considered common knowledge that everyone’s free to use.\\n\\n\\n\\nfeedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services. Feedback is covered in the Service-related communications section below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScope\\n\\nThis license is:\\n\\n\\n\\nworldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world\\n\\n\\n\\nnon-exclusive, which means you can license your content to others\\n\\n\\n\\nroyalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRights\\n\\nThis license allows Google to:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhost, reproduce, distribute, communicate, and use your content\\n\\n— for example, to save your content on our systems and make it accessible from anywhere you go\\n\\n\\n\\npublish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content, if you’ve made it visible to others\\n\\n\\n\\nmodify and create derivative works based on your content, such as reformatting or translating it\\n\\n\\n\\nsublicense these rights to:\\n\\n\\n\\nother users to allow the services to work as designed, such as enabling you to share photos with people you choose\\n\\n\\n\\nour contractors who’ve signed agreements with us that are consistent with these terms, only for the limited purposes described in the Purpose section below\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPurpose\\n\\nThis license is for the limited purpose of:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\noperating and improving the services, which means allowing the services to work as designed and creating new features and functionalities. This includes using automated systems and algorithms to analyze your content:\\n\\n\\n\\nfor spam and malware\\n\\n\\n\\nto recognize patterns in data, such as determining when to suggest a new album in Google Photos to keep related photos together\\n\\n\\n\\nto customize our services for you, such as providing recommendations and personalized search results, content, and ads (which you can change or turn off in Ads Settings)\\n\\nThis analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nusing content you’ve shared publicly to promote the services. For example, to promote a Google app, we might quote a review you wrote. Or to promote Google Play, we might show a screenshot of the app you offer in the Play Store.\\n\\n\\n\\ndeveloping new technologies and services for Google consistent with these terms\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDuration\\n\\nThis license lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you remove from our services any content that’s covered by this license, then our systems will stop making that content publicly available in a reasonable amount of time. There are two exceptions:\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you already shared your content with others before removing it. For example, if you shared a photo with a friend who then made a copy of it, or shared it again, then that photo may continue to appear in your friend’s Google Account even after you remove it from your Google Account.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you make your content available through other companies’ services, it’s possible that search engines, including Google Search, will continue to find and display your content as part of their search results.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUsing Google services\\n\\n\\n\\nYour Google Account\\n\\nIf you meet these age requirements you can create a Google Account for your convenience. Some services require that you have a Google Account in order to work — for example, to use Gmail, you need a Google Account so that you have a place to send and receive your email.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou’re responsible for what you do with your Google Account, including taking reasonable steps to keep your Google Account secure, and we encourage you to regularly use the Security Checkup.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUsing Google services on behalf of an organization or business\\n\\nMany organizations, such as businesses, non-profits, and schools, take advantage of our services. To use our services on behalf of an organization:\\n\\n\\n\\nan authorized representative of that organization must agree to these terms\\n\\n\\n\\nyour organization’s administrator may assign a Google Account to you. That administrator might require you to follow additional rules and may be able to access or disable your Google Account.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nService-related communications\\n\\nTo provide you with our services, we sometimes send you service announcements and other information. To learn more about how we communicate with you, see Google’s Privacy Policy.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you choose to give us feedback, such as suggestions to improve our services, we may act on your feedback without obligation to you.\\n\\n\\n\\nContent in Google services\\n\\n\\n\\nYour content\\n\\nSome of our services allow you to generate original content. Google won’t claim ownership over that content.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome of our services give you the opportunity to make your content publicly available — for example, you might post a product or restaurant review that you wrote, or you might upload a blog post that you created.\\n\\n\\n\\nSee the Permission to use your content section for more about your rights in your content, and how your content is used in our services\\n\\n\\n\\nSee the Removing your content section to learn why and how we might remove user- generated content from our services\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you think someone is infringing your intellectual property rights, you can send us notice of the infringement and we’ll take appropriate action. For example, we suspend or close the Google Accounts of repeat copyright infringers as described in our Copyright Help Center.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle content\\n\\nSome of our services include content that belongs to Google — for example, many of the visual illustrations you see in Google Maps. You may use Google’s content as allowed by these terms and any service-specific additional terms, but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in our content. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos, or legal notices. If you want to use our branding or logos, please see the Google Brand Permissions page.\\n\\n\\n\\nOther content\\n\\nFinally, some of our services give you access to content that belongs to other people or organizations — for example, a store owner’s description of their own business, or a newspaper article displayed in Google News. You may not use this content without that person or organization’s permission, or as otherwise allowed by law. The views expressed in other people or organizations’ content are theirs, and don’t necessarily reflect Google’s views.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo  ware in Google services\\n\\nSome of our services include downloadable or preloaded software. We give you permission to use that software as part of the services.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe license we give you is:\\n\\n\\n\\nworldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world\\n\\n\\n\\nnon-exclusive, which means that we can license the software to others\\n\\n\\n\\nroyalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license\\n\\n\\n\\npersonal, which means it doesn’t extend to anyone else\\n\\n\\n\\nnon-assignable, which means you’re not allowed to assign the license to anyone else\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSome of our services include software that’s offered under open source license terms that we make available to you. Sometimes there are provisions in the open source license that explicitly override parts of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services or software.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn case of problems or disagreements\\n\\nBoth the law and these terms give you the right to (1) a certain quality of service, and (2) ways to fix problems if things go wrong.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWarranty\\n\\nWe provide our services using reasonable skill and care. If we don’t meet the quality level described in this warranty, you agree to tell us and we’ll work with you to try to resolve the issue.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDisclaimers\\n\\nThe only commitments we make about our services (including the content in the services, the specific functions of our services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs) are provided in (1) the Warranty section; (2) the service-specific additional terms; and (3) laws that can’t be limited by these terms.\\n\\n\\n\\nDon’t rely on the services for medical, legal, financial, or other professional advice. Any content regarding those topics is provided for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for advice from a qualified professional.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLiabilities\\n\\n\\n\\nFor all users\\n\\n\\n\\nBoth the law and these terms try to strike a balance as to what you or Google can claim from the other in case of problems. That’s why the law requires everyone to be responsible for certain liabilities — but not others — under these terms.\\n\\nThese terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law. These terms don’t limit liability for:\\n\\n\\n\\nfraud or fraudulent misrepresentation\\n\\n\\n\\ndeath or personal injury caused by negligence\\n\\n\\n\\ngross negligence\\n\\n\\n\\nwillful misconduct\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther than the liabilities described above, Google is liable only for its breaches of these terms or applicable service-specific additional terms, subject to applicable law.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor business users and organizations only\\n\\nIf you’re a business user or organization:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo the extent allowed by applicable law, you’ll indemnify Google and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the services or violation of these terms or service-specific additional terms. This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees, except to the extent a liability or expense is caused by Google's breach, negligence, or willful misconduct.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including indemnification, then those responsibilities don’t apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don’t override those immunities.\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle won’t be responsible for the following liabilities:\\n\\n\\n\\nloss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings\\n\\n\\n\\nindirect or consequential loss\\n\\n\\n\\nExcept as stated in the For all users section above, Google’s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) US$500 or (2) 125% of the fees that you paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the breach.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTaking action in case of problems\\n\\nBefore taking action as described below, we’ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to clarify the issue and address it, unless we reasonably believe that doing so would:\\n\\n\\n\\ncause harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google\\n\\n\\n\\nviolate the law or a legal enforcement authority’s order\\n\\n\\n\\ncompromise an investigation\\n\\n\\n\\ncompromise the operation, integrity, or security of our services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRemoving your content\\n\\nIf we reasonably believe that any of your content (1) breaches these terms, service- specific additional terms or policies, (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, terrorist content, and content that infringes someone else’s intellectual property rights.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSuspending or terminating your access to Google services\\n\\nWithout limiting any of our other rights, Google may suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:\\n\\n\\n\\nyou materially or repeatedly breach these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies\\n\\n\\n\\nwe’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order\\n\\n\\n\\nwe reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google — for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming,\\n\\n\\n\\nmisleading others, or scraping content that doesn’t belong to you\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor more information about why we disable accounts and what happens when we do, see this Help Center page. If you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, you can appeal.\\n\\n\\n\\nOf course, you’re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you do stop using a service, we’d appreciate knowing why so that we can continue improving our services.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSe  ling disputes, governing law, and courts\\n\\nFor information about how to contact Google, please visit our contact page.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCalifornia law will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to these terms, service- specific additional terms, or any related services, regardless of conflict of laws rules. These disputes will be resolved exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Google consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo the extent that applicable local law prevents certain disputes from being resolved in a California court, then you can file those disputes in your local courts. Likewise, if applicable local law prevents your local court from applying California law to resolve these disputes, then these disputes will be governed by the applicable local laws of your country, state, or other place of residence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout these terms\\n\\nBy law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.\\n\\n\\n\\nThese terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don’t create any legal rights for other people or organizations, even if others benefit from that relationship\\n\\n\\n\\nunder these terms.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our services. But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf these terms conflict with the service-specific additional terms, the additional terms will govern for that service.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you don’t follow these terms or the service-specific additional terms, and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe may update these terms and service-specific additional terms (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business — for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements.
